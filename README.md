# StoryExtendedAddon

A dialogue interface for World Of Warcraft to create immersive stories.

This addon adds a dialogue interface using Lua scripting to WoW. It's fairly powerful in its feature set and is modelled after classic RPG dialogue systems.

This is the core addon which is always needed. It works for WoW 1.12, Classic (+Classic WOTLK) and Retail.

## Features
- Branching dialogue
- Looping dialogue
- Conditions for dialogues such as player level or finished quest
- Voice overs
- "Narrator dialogue" on stepping into subzones
- animated 3D portrait for NPCs
- WoW 1.12, Classic and Retail support

## Installation
Download the newest release from the releases page and extract the downloaded zip into your World Of Warcraft/AddOns folder

* *Note: You will need a dialogue Addon as well for any dialogue to show up. As the core addon doesn't contain any dialogue by itself* *

## Writing dialogue
This project is meant as a community effort. That means that everyone should be able to write their own dialogue and release it for everyone to enjoy.

To write your own dialogue either head to https://mnauditt.de/storyextended or head over to https://github.com/Magusbear/StoryExtendedWebApp and install the web app on your local machine.
